Overview

This project demonstrates three presentation-layer architectures — MVC, MVP, and MVVM — using a small inventory-style domain.
Each architecture implements identical business logic but organizes responsibilities differently.
The goal is to illustrate how control flow, dependency directions, and UI-interaction patterns change across architectures.
